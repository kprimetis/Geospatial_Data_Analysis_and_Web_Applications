# Geospatial Data Analysis and Web Applications
## Project Description
This project is the first in a series of three assignments for the course "Geospatial Data Analysis" in the MSc "Data Science and Machine Learning" program. The main objectives of this assignment are to introduce the use of data, metadata and time series from online services, explore spatial relationships, formulate queries and extract data. The assignment also familiarizes students with programming interfaces (e.g., for the Corine Land Cover 2018) and geospatial applications (e.g., QGIS where supplementary use was required).

## Objectives
1. **Data Import and Processing:**
  * Introduction to data, metadata and time series.
  * Understanding spatial relationships, queries and data extraction.
2. **Web Services and Standards:**
  * Familiarization with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web services and standards.
  * Use of programming interfaces (APIs) and geospatial applications.
3. **Geospatial Applications:**
  * Hands-on experience with popular libraries and APIs for importing, processing and visualizing geospatial data.
